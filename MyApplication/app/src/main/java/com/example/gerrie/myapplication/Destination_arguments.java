The island is historically and culturally intertwined with the Indian subcontinent, but is geographically separated from the Indian subcontinent by the Gulf of Mannar and the Palk Strait. The legislative capital, Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte, is a suburb of the commercial capital and largest city, Colombo. Sri Lanka's documented history spans 3,000 years, with evidence of pre-historic human settlements dating back to at least 125,000 years. It has a rich cultural heritage and the first known Buddhist writings of Sri Lanka, the Pāli Canon, date back to the Fourth Buddhist council in 29 BC. Its geographic location and deep harbours made it of great strategic importance from the time of the ancient Silk Road through to the modern Maritime Silk Road. Sri Lanka was known from the beginning of British colonial rule as Ceylon. A nationalist political movement arose in the country in the early 20th century to obtain political independence, which was granted in 1948; the country became a republic and adopted its current name in 1972. The current constitution stipulates the political system as a republic and a unitary state governed by a semi-presidential system. It has had a long history of international engagement, as a founding member of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), and a member of the United Nations, the Commonwealth of Nations, the G77, and the Non-Aligned Movement. Along with the Maldives, Sri Lanka is one of only two South Asian countries rated \"high\" on the Human Development Index (HDI), with its HDI rating and per capita income the highest among South Asian nations. The Sri Lankan constitution accords Buddhism the \"foremost place\", although it does not identify it as a state religion. Buddhism is given special privileges in the Sri Lankan constitution.The island is home to many cultures, languages and ethnicities. The majority of the population is from the Sinhalese ethnicity, while a large minority of Tamils have also played an influential role in the island's history. Moors, Burghers, Malays, Chinese, and the indigenous Vedda are also established groups on the island."});

Pilgrims have been coming to the Nagadeepa since about the 1st century AC to worship at its famous Rajayathana stupa. The Rajayathana stupa was constructed by two warring Naga kings, Chulodara and Mahodara, at the site where Lord Buddha during His second visit to the country on a Bak Maha Amawaka Poya Day, five years after attaining Enlightenment, intervened and mediated in settling a dispute over the possession of a gem-studded throne. The precious throne was offered to the lord Buddha, was returned to the Naga Kings and was later enshrined in this Rajayathana stupa.History records that the Nagadeepa Purana Rajamaha Vharaya was developed and reconstructed by pious kings, Devanampiyatissa, Dutugemunu and converted into a fully accomplished sacred place. During the period of Portuguese, Dutch and British all the Buddhist religious places were destroyed and the Nagadeepa Viharaya too has been subjected to it and Buddhists were deprived of worshiping these religious places.In the year 1931 Ven. Randombe Somatissa Nayake Thero from Ambalangoda has visited this place and observed the ruins of the Rajayathana stupa and the Kiripalu Nuga tree and identified as the stupa constructed with the gem studded throne on which Lord Buddha has preached, and Thero then reconstructed this stupa with the support of donors to enabling Buddhists for their religious observances.Praveenacharya Damma Kiththi Sri Venerable Navadagala Paduma Kiththi Tissa Thero the Chief Sanganayake of the Northern Province is the present chief Incumbent of Nagadeepa Purana Raja Maha Viharaya and he is a pupil of former chief Incumbent Rajakeeya Panditha the Late Most Venerable Brahmmana Watte Damma Kiththi Tissa Nayake Thero of Amarapura Nikaya.The Nagadeepa Purana Rajamaha Viharaya is a shining example of inter racial harmony in Sri lanka and this had been improved at various stages and ever since it has become the most sanctified place of worship by the devotees."});

Almost all legends are connected with the Ramayana, which includes the chronicles of Rama – the seventh avatar of God Vishnu. According to legend, Seetha, wife of Rama, while on the return journey to India was overcome with thirst and as there was no water to be found, Rama had gallantly shot an arrow on to the earth creating a well. Some believe this to be the origin of Nilavarai. However, varying legends replace different characters such as Hanuman, a devotee of Rama, shooting an arrow to create the Well in a bid to quench Rama’s thirst and so on. Regardless, since the olden times the Well has been a source of fresh water that never seems to deplete and is also used for irrigation activities in the area.People around the area claim that the first 40 feet of the Well contains fresh water while the water after this point is deemed to be salty, probably attesting to a connection to the sea at Kankasanturai. The Well has two tunnels and some say that these tunnels are connected to the Keerimalai ponds located near Naguleswaram Temple in Jaffna, while others say that the Well has a connection with an underground tunnel in Matale, which is hundreds of miles from here. \u2028A bystander also told us about an experiment carried out by a gentleman, who put a marked lemon in the waters to find that it surfaced at the Keerimalai ponds.Adding to the Well’s enigmatic aura, according to the folk who live in the area, some foreign scuba divers had attempted to explore the Well with the aid of ropes and oxygen tanks; their attempts to reach the bottom though, proved futile. It is said that they commented on experiencing strong currents; and beingunable to discover the bottom, they left a rope marking the depth that they had been able to reach in their exploration of this remarkable though mysterious Well."});

Reading up on its history and the brilliance of its architectural strategy and seeing the lumps of stone it's now reduced to is pretty painful. If anything, the ruins of Jaffna Fort are a testament to the sheer, futile brutality of human aggression. Fresh after the civil war, the Dutch Government pledged to archaeologically renovate the Fort. The ruins were then opened to the public. Sadly, they pulled funding a year or so later, leaving the ruins partially reconstructed, with ugly scaffoldings and half-baked construction left as is to this day. Here's to hoping GoSL takes up the mantle as they've done with the Colombo heritage buildings. According to Archaeology Daily, a whole host of historically important artifacts were found from various regions and eras. These included pre-colonial artifacts like stones from destroyed temples, medieval pottery, Roman coins, and a Chola inscription presumably from a destroyed temple. These indicated that the site was probably an important spot prior to the construction of the Fort in the early 17th century too.Both the inner and outer defences of the Fort were built in a Vauban star design - a geometrically perfect set of pentagons within each other. This was a a star fort concept that was popularized during mid 15th century Italy, when gunpowder/cannons were invented and protuberant bastions became necessary. An antique blue print of the Fort's design was found which details its features perfectly. The Queen's monument is frequently mentioned in texts from the pre-war period. The church that was erected in 1706 used to be known as one of the North's most important architectural monuments. With its high gabled façade and structured height, it was one of the key visual points of the cityscape. Peruse the photo album for a look at antique sketches of the Church, named Kruys Kerk. With walls some 3 feet in width, buildings like that were built to last, but not built to bear bombs and heavy artillery. The civil war claimed this historical marvel, leaving huge chunks of the heavy limestone walls embedded in the earth. When you draw close, you realise the intense force that had to be used to destroy such heavy, substantial material. It's chilling. The view from the ramparts is just amazing - the aquamarine moats, the azure sea, a lush cricket field, a mosque, the city itself all come into view. These are the bits that managed to get completed by the restoration project, so new stone and mortar have been used to reconstruct the ramparts. It appears as though the restoration project also attempted creating a little mini-museum with facts and pictures of archaeological finds in the North (refer album). The alcoves within the Fort also appear to have lovely wooden bolstering now, which makes it seem as though it has potential to be a chic leisure/tourist area at some point.It's pretty deserted these days, with maybe a few school children on tour or stragglers about. The no entry on foot signs at some areas is a bit unnerving, but probably best followed. "});

Port Kankesan), colloquially known as KKS, is a port suburb, fishing division and resort hub of the Jaffna District, Northern Province, Sri Lanka. Formerly an electoral district, Kankesanthurai is home to the Kankesanthurai beach, Keerimalai Naguleswaram temple (a Pancha Ishwaram) and the Maviddapuram Kandaswamy Temple. The port's harbour has served as an arrival and departure point for pilgrims since classical antiquity and is named after the Sri Lankan Tamil god Murukan. Kankesanthurai suburb has many fishing villages and Grama Niladhari (village officers) and is a northern part of Valikamam, one of the three regions of ancient habitation on the Jaffna peninsula, located on the peninsula's northern coast, 12 miles from Jaffna city, 85 miles from Mannar and 155 miles from Trincomalee.A popular tourist destination for its temples, its sandy, palm tree filled coastal stretch of beach and the Keerimalai Springs, other prominent landmarks in Kankesanthurai include the suburb's natural harbour, its fort and lighthouse. The major resort of Kankesanthurai is the Kankesanthurai Rest House, currently occupied by the Sri Lanka Navy who have renamed and run the resort. The area surrounding it, the Palali-KKS military camp, remains a \"High Security Zone\" of the Sri Lankan armed forces, having expelled all its Sri Lankan Tamil residents (25,000 families) between 1983 and 1993 without compensation or return during the Sri Lankan civil war.An old school of Jaffna, the Kankesanthurai Nadeswara College, reopened in June 2016 at its original site in the suburb after 27 years of closure. The main economy of the district was fishing, tourism, maritime trade and cement manufacture. The climate is tropical and the town is served by the Kankesanthurai railway station and the formerly international Jaffna Airport. Naguleswaram temple is a famous Hindu temple of Kankesanthurai. One of the oldest shrines of the region, it is the northernmost shrine on the island of the Pancha Ishwarams of Lord Siva, venerated by Hindus across the world from classical antiquity. Hindus believe its adjacent water tank, the Keerimalai Springs, to have curative properties. Maviddapuram Kandaswamy Temple is towards the south of the harbour.Keerimalai springs, Kankesanthurai Freshwater at Keerimalai Springs is sourced from underground. \"Maasi Magam\" and “Aadi Amaavaasai” festival days, the latter falling during the Tamil month of “Aadi” (mid July-mid August) brings Hindu pilgrims to the town to carry out rituals for their forefathers and take a divine dip in the natural springs. These rituals are usually carried out by men. Keerimalai is particularly famous for this festival.Kankesanthurai fort was a small fort, built by the Dutch in the town. The fort was destroyed sometime after and there are no visible remains. Unlike other Dutch forts in Sri Lanka, there are no maps and little information remaining on the fort.Kankesanthurai Lighthouse, built in 1893, is 22 metres (72 ft) tall and has an octagonal masonry tower with lantern and gallery. Located deep inside the Sri Lankan military's Valikamam North High Security Zone and next to the naval base, the lighthouse was heavily damaged during the Sri Lankan Civil War and is inactive.Kankesanthurai beach is acclaimed as one of the top two beaches of the Northern Province. A family-orientated sandy beach with palm trees and cool waters, the beach is non-crowded and natural from where views of the villagers' fisheries at the harbour, medieval architecture and the lighthouse are possible."});

With the advent of the Dutch, the little island was known as Leiden and finally it was christened as Kayts during the British era and continues to be known by this name today. Wandering along the many little roads in and around Kayts, the simplistic life of this quaint island drew us further in. Kayts, supposedly had a port— Urundai—and with that a fort. However, this fort is in ruins today. Built using coral and sandstone like many others in the region, it takes a little bit of imagination to conjure an image of what it would have been like. A few sections of the walls remain, demarcating the boundary of the fort. With the ocean just a few steps away, the view from this fort is beautiful. Fort Hammenhiel, built by the Portuguese and later occupied by the Dutch and the British was regarded as the key to Jaffna. This is situated on a small islet between Kayts and Karainagar and could be seen from where we were standing. It was evening and catching the ferry that took people across did not seem to be the best use of our time so we continued on with our exploration.Kayts town was very small, with just a few buildings that reminded us of a little country town in Europe. Everywhere we turned, there were buildings from a very different era. There were those that were somewhat intact and others just skeletons of their previous selves. It is said that Kayts had been a vibrant place and little by little life seemed to be returning to this beautiful isle.This thought just struck me— Kayts is an island of an island… like so many others around the Jaffna peninsula… interesting. Kayts was as laidback as any other part of the country, but also had a certain feeling that I would say was unique to Kayts. As the evening sun spread its glorious rays, the autumn leaves gave colour to the dry landscape. We had heard of Charti Beach, and that is where we headed. It was the time of year where seaweed is pushed ashore and as such the ocean was a different shade. The beach spread as far as the eye could see and maybe when the tide is low you could walk right along till the end. Charti Beach is also well known as a swimming spot and with all the facilities of changing rooms and shower areas it is ideal for a relaxing morning or afternoon.With the sun receding in the Northern sky we bade farewell to this little island, vowing to return very soon. We had only captured a few moments of Kayts but it was apparent that we had only touched the tip of the iceberg."});

As we entered the island we saw many fishing vessels, indicating that it was a fishing village.It is advised to pack lunch before heading to Delft Island as there are no places to dine and only a handful of retail shops are available to purchase snacks or soft drinks. Many sites are located within walking distance but the best option would be to hire a three-wheeler or a smaller lorry for the journey, as the harsh conditions could exhaust any traveller, before you could enjoy the real beauty of the island.Similar to the main land, the island too basked in bright sunlight, but the Palmyra growth in the island was a relief, providing shade throughout our journey. Greeted by some natives of the island, our journey began inwards where we witnessed the lifestyle of its citizens.The whole island was based on coral and limestone. The island was underdeveloped, but due to its population of approximately 4,500 people, who used cycles as the main transport mode, the roads were not crowded and the journey inwards was easy.Going further it was just bare land which was underutilized by the citizens of the island."});

Elephant Pass, the bottleneck gateway to Jaffna peninsula fell into Army hands on 9th January 2009 again after Elephant Pass Army camp was captured by LTTE terrorists on 20th April 2000. Heroic soldiers, as the Wanni humanitarian operations were on, torpedoed LTTE strongholds completely and recaptured the entire isthmus, marking a milestone in the annals of the Eelam history.Friday’s (30) unveiling of the Elephant Pass War Hero Memorial by Mr Rajapaksa on the invitation of Lieutenant General Jagath Jayasuriya, Commander of the Army signals the importance being attached to the memory of those yesteryear patriots whose dedication and selfless sacrifices brought the war against terrorism to an end. Mr Rajapaksa on arrival at Elephant Pass was warmly welcomed by Commander of the Army, Lieutenant General Jagath Jayasuriya and Major General Mahinda Hathurusinghe, Commander, Security Forces, Jaffna. A bevy of traditional Kandyan dancers accompanied him to the dais, from where the Secretary Defence received the salute and inspected the Guard of Honour. Mr Rajapaksa amidst rhythms of auspicious drums, tuned by Army drummers afterwards unveiled the main plaque at the entrance to the War Hero Memorial and declared it open formally while the Commander of the Army Lieutenant General Jagath Jayasuriya seconds after that opened the plaque on the monument itself. The plaques extol numerous and invaluable sacrifices made by War Heroes of our times and unfailing directives given by none other than personages, like HE the President as Commander-in-Chief, Secretary Defence Mr Gotabaya Rajapaksa, et al. Other sides of the monument have been dedicated to the Sri Lanka Navy and Air Force.  Mr Rajapaksa on the sidelines of the main event spoke to media personnel covering the occasion and briefed them on the forthcoming “Victory Day”, War Hero commemorative arrangements and the importance of maintaining the status quo after elimination of the LTTE terrorism. This work of great artistic merit has been designed by Sri Lanka’s National Design Centre (NDC). Mr Sunil Fernando (Chairman-NDC), supported by Messrs Torin Chandrasekara and G.C.N Perera has done the meticulous architectural design of this unique masterpiece. Work of this 42 ft high monumental erection with Army resources commenced on 7th July 2009 with the support of Engineer Service Regiment.   "});

But soon, with the royal patronage, the sanctuary housed a multitude of with monastic buildings-stupas, uposathgharas, bodhigharas- to serve the monks. Sixty eight cave dwellings provided the monks shade and shelter. Mihintale, the sanctuary for many thousands of laymen as well as holy men, had all the facilities and amenities for basic living. With the growth of the community of monks and the pious laymen, there arose the inevitable need of a hospital. The first hospital at Mihintale was founded by King Sena the second (853-887 AC) at Mihintale. The identification was based on a tenth century inscription found at the site.Today, the ruins of a hospital with its layout restored can be seen at the entrance to the site of Mihintale. At the entrance to the hospital is the outer courtyard that consists of four rooms: consulting room; room for preparation and storage of medicine; room for hot water baths. At the end of the outer courtyard, to the north is the main building: the quadrangular courtyard having a small shrine in the center.The rooms are arranged on a two high platforms on all four sides of the Central Courtyard. The rooms face the shrine which is in the Courtyard. The area of each room is about 100 square feet. The rooms open onto an inner Verandha making all cells accessible.Archeological excavations have unearthed clay wares and blue colored jars. These jars are another evidence of the cultural and trade connections with Iran and Sri Lanka at such an ancient time. Between the ancient hospital and the great stairway to the mountain of Mihintale are ruins of ancient monastic buildings girt by a boundary wall. The entrance to the monastery is decorated with steps, Guard-Stones, makara (dragon) balustrades and naga (cobra) figures. This building is similar to arama buildings found in Anuradhapura.

The sacred Bodhi sapling has been ceremonially brought here by Arahant Sanghamitta Maha Theree, under instructions of Arahant Mihindu Maha Thero. King Devanampiyatissa who ruled Sri Lanka in this period has planted this Bodhi tree with great pageantry in the Maha Megha Vana Royal Park dedicated to the venerable bhikkhus. The present age of the Anuradhapura Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi is 2,247 years.Accordingly, the oldest tree of the whole world with a written history is the Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi of Anuradhapura.This tree belongs to the family of trees known as ‘asvastha’ in Sanskrit, ‘asvattha’ in Pali, ‘aesatu’ in Sinhala. Botanists have named it ‘ficus religiosa’ taking into account its religious significance.Lord Gautama Buddha is esteemed as the greatest human being appeared on earth.

The saplings sprouted from its roots were destroyed twice due to hostilities and natural disasters. It is a fourth generation Bodhi tree that dwells in Bodhgaya presently.But, what we see living in Anuradhapura is the southern branch of the original Bodhi tree under which Gautama Buddha was seated with his back against it. Therefore, the Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi tree of Anuradhapura is the only sacred relic in the whole world comparable to the living Buddha, which has been sanctified by the touch of the Lord Buddha and was subjected to the homage of the esteemed one himself for one whole week through ‘Animisa Lochana Pooja’.It is a specialty here that, this highly sacred Bodhi could be seen and worshipped by anyone without hindrance."});

Designed by Arhants or enlightened ones themselves archaeologists and investigators inquire the greater purpose of a stupa whose construction was predicted by Buddha and was awaited by Arhants, gods and humans.Built nearly 2500 years ago,accomplishing a prediction made by Lord Buddha himself, Ruwanweli Seya or the pagoda of golden dust, was one of the largest structures in the ancient world, standing 103 m tall with a circumference of 290 m.Also known as the Mahathupa, Swarnamali Chaitya, Suvarnamali Mahaceti and Rathnamali Dagaba, the stupa is an engineering feast and a testimony to the engineering capabilities of the ancient Sri Lankans.  Yet with the advancement of the sciences and understanding of the Mahathupa’s true structure many experts and commoners alike are questioning the true purpose of the Mahathupa. Is it only a mega structure protecting and encasing the relics of Lord Buddha or did it have a larger function still unknown to the ‘advanced’ civilisations of today.Unlike with any other giants stupas found in the country, Mahavansa, the great chronicle of Sri Lanka, records the minute details and items involved in building the Mahathupa. Every detail from the preparation of ground initiated by King Dutugamunu to the ending of constructions by his brother King Saddatissa had been faithfully recorded and many wonder whether this record keeping was done for a purpose.A pillar recording this future occurrence was established by King Devanampiyatissa under the guidance of ArhantMahinda on its location nearly two hundreds before the Mahathupa was built. According to the legends the site itself had been graced by four Buddhas; Kakusanda, Konagamaand Kassapa in earlier times and further by Gauthama Buddha during his third visit to Sri Lanka.Another five hundred years later, on aVesak full moon Poya day, King Dutugamunu had the inscribed stone pillar that was erected by King DevanampiyaTissa, removed and the site levelled. The foundation was dug to a depth of seven cubits, spread with round stones, which were then crushed into smaller pieces. The stones were then stamped upon by elephants with leather shoes. Fine clay from Himalaya was spread on the stones with layers of bricks, rough plaster, quartz, a network of iron, fragrant clay, white stones, rock crystals and slabs of stones placed over it. Mercury, resin of the wood-apple, and fine clay mixed together were spread over the slabs of stones while bronze sheets of eight inches thickness were laid over the mixture. It was spread with arsenic and sesame oil mixed together and covered with silver sheets of four inches thickness.Once the foundation is completed the arhants present had made the foundation sink into the earth making space for another foundation. According to the Mahavamsa, this process had been repeated seven times, to strengthen the Mahathupa, that it would stand the worst earthquake or natural disaster.The relic chamber of the Mahathupa, which had never being archaeologically excavated is believed to contain a drona of relics of Lord Buddha, treasured inside a pure gold relic chambers adorned with gold, silver and gems. The walls of the relic chamber is said to be adorned with the murals depicting samsara cycle of Lord Buddha, silver and copper vases and a replica of a Bo-tree made out of silver. The relic casket is placed on a vajrasana or a seat of diamonds and is sealed inside with stone slabs by Arhants.The Arhants then determined that ‘The relic-chamber shall not shake even by an earthquake; flowers that were offered on that day shall not wither till the end of Buddha Gotama's Dispensation; the lamps that were kindled shall not be extinguished; the clay that was mixed with perfume and sandalwood shall not dry; even a single scratch shall not appear within the relic-chamber; stains shall not appear in any of the golden goods that were offered.’. They also determined also that inimical persons should not be able to even see the relic-chamber.When the great stupa was only partially completed its creator, King Dutugamunu, passed away leaving the responsibility of concluding the work to his brother King Saddatissa. Under his patron ship the Mahathupa was given a chathra or a parasol, which is not found today and a wall of tuskers around Mahathupa, which is found even today. According to the Mahavansa, the chathra contained a circle of diamonds, explained as a Vajrachumbaka, and a large ruby at the top.Architect ShreenAmendra, in her book ‘Beyond the Seeing Eye; The Mahathupa of Lanka’, questions whether the purpose of the Mahathupa’s parasol was to attract lightening and to be excited into its piezo-electric properties to oscillate at its particular frequency, emitting a pulse which could be detected by heavens above.The chathra was accompanied by an upakhila, which is placed below the chathra and is made out of copper. Use of copper in the Upakhila, which is connected to the chathra, which attracts electricity, suggests that the chathra and upkhilawere used to harvest electricity through thunder head clouds. Amendra further comments that use of high conductive metal in relic chamber and in the foundation is formula of a grand design which was meant to create an intricate circuit, with semiconductors, capacitors, emitters and groundings with the sacred relics in the centre as the source of power."});

This carved stone was found in the royal pleasure garden and brought here. There are many interpretations for this carving.The most popular is that this carving shows the prince Saliya (the son of the great king Dutugamunu) and his mistress Asokamala. Asokamala was of a lover cast called “Chandala” and the prince Saliya gave up the right to be the king by marrying this girl of a lower cast.Another belief is that this couple represent the god Siva and goddess Parvathi of Hindu belief.The vihara also has another stone slab which depicts a court scene which is thought to be the court of king Dutugemunu.

Above the pond there is a carving of bathing elephants and on the top-level of the stairs there is another carving of a man seated in a royal pose and a horse head.

The king Gothabhaya took the side of the Maha Vihara and took severe measures against the monks of the Abhayagiri Monastery. During this time the monks of this monastery had to seek sanctuary in India.One of the disciples of the banished monks called Sangamitta thero decided to avenge the bikkus of Mahavihara. He came back to Sri Lanka and gained the favour of king Gothabhaya (253-266 AC) and was entrusted to teach his two sons prince Mahasena and Prince Jetthatissa. After their father’s death, the elder son prince Jetthatissa who was a supporter of the Mahavihara monks became the king and reigned for 10 years (266-276 AC). In 276 Mahasena (276-303) succeeded to the throne and the monk Sangamitta immediately came back to the island. He persuaded the king that the Mahaviharians laxed discipline and the monks of Abhayagiri vihara preached the true doctrine of the Buddha. He also persuaded the king to order prohibition of giving arms to the Mahaviharians and they were forced to retreat to the hills and Rohana.Then Sangamittha thero persuaded the king to razor the Maha Vihara buildings and use the materials to build up a new rival institute within the boundaries of Maha Vihara itself. This became to known as the Jethawana.However this act brought a great and disastrous civil war and the monk Sangamitta was killed by the queen of the king. Later the king bowing down to public pressure restored the Maha Vihara buildings and ruled for 27 years.Jethawana Stupa is the largest stupa in the Sri Lanka. It was originally 400 feet (122 meters) in height and was the third tallest building in the world at that time. Even today as a brick monument, Jethawanaramaya still remains the tallest of its kind in the world.Jethawanaramaya was built by King Mahasena of Anuradhapura (276-303) was completed by his son Sirimeghavanna. It is believed that this monument was built upon the enclosure where Mahinda Maha Thero was cremated. Recent excavation in the stupa has unearthed a one meter thick brick wall adjacent to a layer of ash and charcoal. This is believed to be the chamber where the remains of the great thero rest.As all other buildings in Anuradhapura this too was subjected to destruction by North Indian Invaders. Then when the Anuradhapura was finally abandoned as the capital in the 11th century this stupa with others were covered by the jungle. King Parakramabahu (12th century) in the Pollonaruwa era again tried to renovate this stupa and it was rebuilt to the current height, a reduction from the original height. Today it stands at 232 feet (71 meters) .Today this stupa is going through a painful and slow conservation to bring it to its ancient glory.

The stupa was built on the instructions of Mahinda Thero who brought Buddhism to the island to enshrine the right collar-bone of Lord Buddha. On this stupa you can see a unique architectural feature called vatadage, a stupa-house. This building completely housed the stupa. At present four concentric circles of stone pillars are found around the stupa. They diminish in height from inner most circle and at one time carried the weight of a dome-shaped roof over the stupa. There has been 176 pillars which supported this stupa house and in 1896, 31 complete pillars with capitals has been standing. This vatadage has been built in the 1st century AC. In the seventh century BC the stupa was covered with a gold and silver casing and the vatadagê (stupa-house) with golden bricks and golden doors. Then Pandyans (south Indian Tamil) plundered the stupa of it’s all gold, jewels and treasures. Again Mahinda IV (956-972) re installed the golden casings and the golden doors but again in the late 10th century Colas (south Indian Tamil) completely plundered the complex of its valuables.

There also has been a 20 foot (6.1 meters) high Buddha statue made out of green jade. This monument is carries a special importance in ancient Sri Lankan Stupas as the top portions of the original stupa (known the “hatharas kotuwa”) still survives after thousand years of negligence, giving a glimpse to what it would have looked like thousand years ago. Today there is a massive effort by the archeological department to restore this stupa to its original glory without destroying the archeological value. The work has been painstakingly slow due to the lack of funds. As you can see in the pictures, the stupa is still covered by grass and trees grown on it which more like a mound of earth. The story of the birth of this aramic complex is very interesting. According to the chronicles, soon after the king Vattagamini Abaya ascended to the throne in 104 BC, a Tamil invasion took place. The new king unable to withstand the attack, was retreating from the capital. At this time a Jain monk was residing in the area which Abhayagiri stands today. When the king was passing this area the Jain monk named “Geri” shouted insultingly “Lo the great black Sinhala king is in flight”. The king ignored this comment but when he came back to Anuradhapura after 14 years after defeating the the invaders, he has not forgotten this incident. The king razed this hermitage to the ground and built a massive stupa and 12 buildings and offered it to Mahathissa Thero. The stupa was named by coining the two rivals names “Abaya” (The king’s name) and “Geri” (The Jain monk) – The “Abayagiri” Later, this vihara became a rival to Mahavihara. Mahaviharians were followers of pure “Theravada Buddhism” and the priests at the Abayagiri were open to more ideas and followed principles of both Theravada and Mahayana teachings."});

The two ponds differ in their lengths such that Southern pond is greater than Northern pond nearly by 41 feet and depth differs nearly by 3 feet. By using the steps or staircase, one can reach the bottom of the ponds. The water supply to the ponds were transferred from three reservoirs or water tanks named Tissawewa Basawakkulama, and Nuwarawewa along pipelines connected under the ground. First, the water filled to a tank which was built above the ground level of twin ponds. Then the smaller pond was filled by water through “makara kata”, mouth of dragon from that tank. Now finally the larger pond filled with water from the smaller pond through a small opening which located below the ground level. This is nearly equal to present underground pipeline system.

Their theory is built up on the fact that in 2400 BC the stargate in Abu Ghurab Egypt was surrounded by water while” La Puerta de HayuMarka.” Or “The Gateway to The Gods” in Peru too is built closer Lake Titicaca, with underground water tunnels and chambers beneath the pyramids. The advocates of the ‘processing gold from the waters of Earth’ theory believes that these water channels, chambers, reservoirs and filters found near each stargate to have been a part of a sophisticated mechanism developed by extraterrestrials thousands of years ago. If the theory is held to be true, RanmasuUyana had once been a ‘gold processing center of extraterrestrials’, which arrived on earth through stargates. Yet archaeologists are eager to discard these theories as pure imagination. According to the earliest archaeologists and historians the charts could have been a descriptive chart of the universe according to Buddhism or a simple map of the earth. At later stages the historians have interpreted them as descriptions of animal evolution or as the way Tantric Buddhist monks perceived the world. It is believed that they used them for meditation purposes as well. Present day archaeologist abhor the thought of comparing Egyptian civilisation with the Sri Lankan civilisation, insisting that ours is a unique island civilisation pure of Egyptian or Babylonian influence. Whatever their initial use may have been, the interpretations provided for these markings varies from a secret key to space travelling to the floor plan of Sigiriya, a rock garden found closer to Anuradhapura. Yet the only fact about these charts is that despite various claims and arguments, we are nowhere near to understanding them or knowing their sources."});

During the olden days in India, the standard methods of worship for this god often involved animal sacrifice; though human sacrifice was never involved. But for some reason this practice seems to have gotten twisted in the localisation process; and the priests of this temple threatened the wrath of the god unless hundreds of virgin women were sacrificed in time. The naive people of the region handed over a large number of girls for sacrifice and lived in fear of the god’s wrath. However, this came to an end when the fiance of the Chief of the Royal Mahouts was taken for sacrifice. The man, whose name was Dunuwilla Gajanayake Nilame, used his power in the palace and his bravery to get her released; and caused such a great disturbance that the sacrificing ritual was broken. This marked the end of the people’s fear and superstition; and the temple was abandoned with time.Another story speaks of how the hill gained the name ‘Gnome Mountain’ or ‘Devil’s Hill’. According to this legend there was a time in the past when the mountain emitted strange noises and engulfed the people who lived nearby in abject fear. They believed that it was the work of an evil gnome and searched for a way to appease it. Meanwhile, unknown to anyone, an actual gnome had infilitrated the palace and taken the place of one of the ministers. Realising the opportunity; the ‘minister’ advised the king that the gnome would be appeased if a beautiful virgin was sacrificed every year, and hence a new superstition began. But then one year; the nominated sacrifice was the lover of the fake minister’s very own son. The villagers kidnapped her during the night, took her to the hill and left her there. The minister’s son discovered this in the morning and immediately set off to rescue her. He fought the gnome , his father, who had been there for his own nefarious purposes; and returned to the village. The alarmed and fearful people had begun to wonder if the rescue of the sacrifice had angered the gnome; when the cunning son quickly made a gnome sound (after all he was a gnome too, being the son of the original gnome). The people the took this to mean that the sacrifice was accepted; and the couple left the village that same night, instead of risk having their trick being discovered."});

The initial fortifications, which were built in the late 16th century, were quite basic. However the fort underwent extensive modifications in the 17th century by the Dutch, making it one of the most important archeological, architectural and historic monuments to illutrate the European influence in South East Asia between the 16th and 19th centuries. According to a statement by UNESCO the site was recognized as a World Heritage Site for its unique exposition of an urban ensemble which illustrates the interaction of European architecture and South Asian traditions from the 16th to the 19th centuries which is the criteterion number four for such recognition.The earliest records of Galle trace back to its mention in Ptolemy’s World Map in the 2nd century AD.It is said to have been a busy port trading with some of the biggest powers of that time; such as Greece, Arabia and China.Galle is also mentioned in records of the 6th century traveller Cosmas Indicopleustes as a port of call of the ship Levant during his visit to Sri Lanka.Another historically famed traveller, Ibn Batuta who lived in the 14th century also mentions having passed through the port on his visit to Sri Pada and Tenavaram Temple which were then some of the most famous sites of Sri Lanka."});

This fun coastal town, 14 km away from Galle was the first (1960’s) of Sri Lanka’s beautiful beaches to be discovered by tourists. Snorkelling and diving in the clear waters are a major past-time along this stretch and is the most environmentally friendly way to see the colourful fish that dart around. The coral sanctuary found along the coast of Hikkaduwa is a large shallow body of water enclosed by a reef, decorated with layers of multi coloured corals, and is home to countless numbers of vibrantly coloured fish. Off the beach there is a collection of small islets surrounded by beautiful coral formations. Many species of fish and large turtles are found here. There are more than four different shipwrecks for diving enthusiasts to explore along with dive shops offering PADI courses and equipment.With plenty of beachfront accommodation and a reputation as the second best surf spot in Sri Lanka, the reason why so many visit Hikkaduwa is blatantly clear. The resort area has now engulfed two or three villages south of it, and is now a 4km strip of hotels, shops, bars, restaurants and guesthouses. The beaches are lovely and wide and swimming is safe here, though the currents are stronger when it comes to the south of Hikkaduwa. The impressive coral reef runs just offshore and is still populated by exotic fish and sea turtles. Glass bottomed boats are available for visitors wanting to admire the wonders of the deep while keeping their feet dry! After a short distance southwards from the centre of the reef, it diminishes and starts a wider sandy bottomed beach with good waves ideal for board surfing and body surfing."});

The remains of this history can still be seen everywhere from its cobblestoned streets, to the historic monuments, to the many still functional structures such as the Galle Lighthouse.The Galle Lighthouse, or Pointe de Galle Light as it was also known, was the very first light station to be built in Sri Lanka. Dating back to 1848; the lighthouse was built by the British to ensure the safe arrival of their ships at the Galle harbour. This original structure stood 24.5 m tall (80 feet) and was located at a site approximately 100 feet from the current lighthouse. Its light was made with a prism lens of glass, which floated in a bath of mercury (to reduce friction); and was powered by a weight driven machine.This lighthouse was destroyed in 1934.The current lighthouse structure was built in 1939; erected within the walls of the ancient Galle Fort with a height of 26.5m (87 feet). The lightstation stands at a strategic location at the southern end of the promontory; built approximately 6m above the road level on the ramparts of the Fort, at a place known as the Point Utrecht Bastion . This affords it an undisturbed view across the seascape; and allowing any incoming ships to see its light.The Galle Lighthouse is currently operated and managed by the Sri Lanka Ports Authority. The lights work through a computerized system which allows the foremost light to switch on every night and switch off in the morning. Visitors are not allowed to climb the lighthouse."});

It is similar in style to the ones in Negapatnam and Cochin in India, even including the walls. It is built on the site of an earlier Portuguese convent. Around the church and within the walls is a small graveyard. It was a Sunday, a weekend I was spending in Galle, sometime in the 1970’s. Sitting on the verandah of the New Oriental Hotel, in the Fort of Galle with my father, the late R. L. Brohier, a waiter mentioned that a few days before , in the garden of the Dutch Church next door to the hotel, the earth had caved in. I walked across to investigate. Yes, the earth on the north-side of the Church had fallen in, leaving an entrance hole large enough to creep into. Adventurous as I was wont to be, cautiously on my belly hands and knees scraping, I crawled my way down. A few feet in, I found I was in a chamber where I was able to stand up. It was damp and musty of smell. Long stalactites were hanging down, dripping and trickling with water, from a vaulted roof. By the dim light which filtered in I was able to discern a centre pillar from where flowed arches of lime-stone. The place was eerie in atmosphere — so not lingering too long I crept out again, into the sunlight.“That’s a Burial Chamber”, said my father, when I reported back though he gave me sharp admonition for the danger I had exposed myself to. Knowledgeable as he was, from researching into old records and books, my father then explained that such Burial Chambers had been known to exist, to hold the embalmed remains of eminent personages in Dutch times.It was to such a Chamber that the body of Gerard Hulft , the Dutch Commander who was killed during the siege of Colombo, was kept. For it is on record that, “the body of General Hulft was received in Galle three days after his untimely death …. and placed within a masonry catalogue in De Groot Kerk for one year. Thereafter, it was lowered into a grave on the right of the pulpit within the Church — the General’s arms and spurs being hung on the wall, over the grave. The following year, 1658, the Dutch conquest of coastal Ceylon being complete, the body of Hulft was removed to the State Dutch Church, within the Colombo Fort, where it was placed in a tomb"});
